# Welcome to My Website!

I am a third-year Economics Ph.D. student at Emory University, working under the supervision of [Dr. Karen Kopecky](https://www.karenkopecky.net/). Before joining Emory, I graduated from Illinois State University with a MSc in Mathematics and a MSc in Economics.

## Research Interests

My research interests lie broadly in macroeconomics and quantitative modeling. I am particularly interested in studying:
- Racial wealth inequality
- Social security systems
- Labor markets
- Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian (HANK) models

## About Me

In my free time, I enjoy:
- Painting
- Playing soccer
- Reading poetry (a huge fan of Rumi!)
