Welcome to my website!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Emory University. My research focuses on macroeconomics, household finance, and public policy, with a particular emphasis on Social Security design, retirement inequality, and labor supply decisions across demographic groups. I use structural models and micro-level data to analyze how institutions and policies shape economic outcomes for women and minorities. I hold a B.A. in Economics from the University of Tehran and a dual M.S. in Quantitative Economics and Applied Mathematics from Illinois State University.
I am also passionate about leadership development and empowering female students in the field of economics. I co-teach a global leadership course at Emory University aimed at mentoring female students and fostering inclusive professional growth.
