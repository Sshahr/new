I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Emory University. I hold a B.A. in Economics from the University of Tehran and a dual M.S. in Quantitative Economics and Mathematics from Illinois State University. 

My research focuses on macroeconomics, household finance, and public policy, with a particular emphasis on Social Security and pension design. I use structural models and micro-level data to analyze how policies affect economic outcomes for the aging population.

I recently accepted a PhD internship position at the [Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta](https://www.atlantafed.org/).
